#another example to practice .each method in my love_loop.rb exercise:

  "I love being with you",
  "I love waking up to you",
  "I love how you make me feel",
  "I want us to grow old together",
  "I'm here for you honey",
  "I love you baby",
  "I love you, if you are bad, I still love you"]
  
  all_love_notes.each do |note|
